Append to nvALT journal
=======================

[Alfred.app](http://www.alfredapp.com/) extension for
[nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/)

I have this extension mapped to the keyword "nj" (for "nvALT Journal").
I activate Alfred and type "nj &lt;text&gt;" and the extension
automatically opens up nvALT and makes sure that there's a note with the
current date in the form "YYYY-mm-dd" and then appends my text to the
end of the note with a 24 hour timestamp in front of it. It then
switches back to the application that I was previously in so I can go
immediately back to whatever I was doing.
